Transportation contributes to the economic, industrial social and cultural development of any country. Transportation is vital for the economic development of any region since every commodity produced whether it is food, clothing, industrial products or medicine needs transport at all stage from production to distribution. In the production stage, transportation is required for carrying raw materials like seeds, manure, coal, steel etc. In the distribution stage, transportation is required from the production center viz. forms and factories and the consumers for distribution. The inadequate transportation facilities retard the process of socio-economic development of the country. The academy of transportation system of a country indicates its economic and social development.
